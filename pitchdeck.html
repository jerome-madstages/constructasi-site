    <h1>CASI / Daywalker Roadmap</h1>
    <p>Our general deck outlines CASI’s roadmap from Daywalker to CASITY.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase I – Building the Foundation</h2>
      <p>We’re proving the core idea: symbolic intelligence that remembers, reasons, and aligns with truth. Our first step is Daywalker, an Unreal Engine 5 plugin with persistent memory. This prototype shows how CASI’s symbolic compression can cut energy, time, and data costs by orders of magnitude.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase II – Expanding and Piloting</h2>
      <p>Next, we grow Daywalker into a full product suite. We’ll release Daywalker Pro with modular tools for developers, educators, and creatives. At the same time, we’ll launch pilot projects in education, healthcare, and industry — real-world tests of CASI’s symbolic runtime. We’ll also introduce Pops, a symbolic interface, and begin building CASITY, our multi-user intelligence platform.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase III – Scaling for Impact</h2>
      <p>Finally, we scale. CASITY becomes a national-scale symbolic intelligence system — transparent, efficient, and covenant-aligned. Daywalker modules extend across industries, helping individuals, institutions, and governments think and act with continuity, clarity, and meaning.</p>

    <h2>Daywalker to CASI Roadmap</h2>
    <p>Daywalker is our first CASI application—a UE5 plugin that demonstrates persistent memory, symbolic alignment, and developer-first workflows. This roadmap unifies the original 3-phase vision with the current build plan:</p>
    <p><strong>Phase I — Foundation</strong><br>Prove the core idea: symbolic intelligence that remembers, reasons, and aligns with truth. Deliver the initial Daywalker plugin with Dev Chat (local Unreal-first), a llama.cpp runner, lightweight proxy, persistent memory scaffold, and UE5 integration/docs. Release cadence under Apache-2.0.</p>
    <p><strong>Phase II — Productization (Daywalker Pro)</strong><br>Expand into a full product suite: modular tools and editor UI, persona presets, scene state capture/recall, and tool APIs for games, simulations, and training. Package and distribute for developers, educators, and creatives.</p>
    <p><strong>Phase III — Conversational & Integrations</strong><br>Introduce Pops, the conversational layer, with bridges for ConduitAI, ResidentAI, and GuestAI (interop with consumer models). Add safety/observability rails and pilot projects across education, healthcare, and industry.</p>
    <p><strong>Phase IV — CASITY Alignment & Scale</strong><br>Evolve to a multi-user symbolic runtime with orchestration and governance. Achieve performance targets in energy/time/data efficiency. Provide SDKs and enterprise modules leading toward CASITY, a national-scale symbolic intelligence platform.</p>
