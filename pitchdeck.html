    <h1>CASI / Daywalker Roadmap</h1>
    <p>Our general deck outlines CASI’s roadmap from Daywalker to CASITY.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase I – Building the Foundation</h2>
      <p>We’re proving the core idea: symbolic intelligence that remembers, reasons, and aligns with truth. Our first step is Daywalker, an Unreal Engine 5 plugin with persistent memory. This prototype shows how CASI’s symbolic compression can cut energy, time, and data costs by orders of magnitude.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase II – Expanding and Piloting</h2>
      <p>Next, we grow Daywalker into a full product suite. We’ll release Daywalker Pro with modular tools for developers, educators, and creatives. At the same time, we’ll launch pilot projects in education, healthcare, and industry — real-world tests of CASI’s symbolic runtime. We’ll also introduce Pops, a symbolic interface, and begin building CASITY, our multi-user intelligence platform.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Phase III – Scaling for Impact</h2>
      <p>Finally, we scale. CASITY becomes a national-scale symbolic intelligence system — transparent, efficient, and covenant-aligned. Daywalker modules extend across industries, helping individuals, institutions, and governments think and act with continuity, clarity, and meaning.</p>

      <h2>CASI / Daywalker Roadmap</h2>
      <p>Daywalker is our first CASI application—a UE5 plugin that demonstrates persistent memory, symbolic alignment, and developer-first workflows. The roadmap below condenses our current build plan and future alignment with CASI and CASITY.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase I — Foundation (v0.1 → v0.1.1)</strong>: Dev Chat (local, Unreal-first) with llama.cpp runner and lightweight proxy; initial persistent memory scaffold; UE5 integration and docs; Apache-2.0 licensing and baseline release cadence.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase II — Productization (Daywalker Pro)</strong>: modular tools and editor UI; persona presets; scene state capture and recall; tool APIs for games/sims/training; packaging and distribution for developers, educators, and creatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase III — Conversational & Integrations</strong>: Pops conversational layer; bridges for ConduitAI, ResidentAI, and GuestAI to interoperate with consumer models; safety/observability rails; pilot projects in education, healthcare, and industry.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase IV — CASITY Alignment & Scale</strong>: multi-user symbolic runtime; orchestration and governance; performance targets (energy/time/data efficiency); SDKs and enterprise modules; path to national-scale deployment aligned with CASI.</li>
      </ul>
