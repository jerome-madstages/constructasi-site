      <h2>Company Overview</h2>
      <p>ConstructASI is a family-built company founded by Jerome and Joshua Madson. It began during the COVID-19 shutdown, when the entertainment industry needed new ways to work. What started as survival—building virtual set environments for film and television—became a proving ground for the blend of creativity, technology, and resilience that defines ConstructASI today.</p>
      <p>The first phase, MadStages Virtual Production Studios, let producers shoot in shared virtual sets that mirrored real locations. As restrictions lifted, the team pivoted into metaverse environments, virtual music videos, short films, and full game development pipelines.</p>
      <p>In that context, our AI work began. A client asked for better game characters—agents that remember, adapt, and interact authentically. That seed became Daywalker, the first product of our AI research. The broader vision, Construct World, pushed us to overcome data and compute limits in existing AI—leading directly to Beboop, CASI’s symbolic engine.</p>
      <p>Today, ConstructASI builds authentic symbolic intelligence. Over five years, we have grown from a virtual production studio into an AI innovator. Jerome’s architectural systems background and Joshua’s creative development expertise combine deep technical design with storytelling and world-building—allowing us to invent new architectures and translate them into products people can use.</p>
      <p>ConstructASI exists to deliver what earlier AI pioneers left unfinished: scalable symbolic intelligence that remembers, reasons, and aligns with truth. Our dual leadership—system design and creative application—positions us to bring CASI from first prototypes (Daywalker) to national-scale deployment (CASITY).</p>
